# Qwen3.8 CPU reference checks (Linux)

This documents the text reference and initial CUDA quant-kernel checks, not the
requested CUDA + vision MVP. End-to-end CUDA Qwen inference, vision, full
chat/tool template parity and recurrent disk cache serialization are not
implemented yet. Unsupported cache operations fail
explicitly; they must not save a DeepSeek-shaped payload.

## No-model kernel tests

```sh
make test-qwen38-cpu
SANITIZE=1 tests/run_qwen38_cpu.sh
```

These test the actual private functions in `ds4.c`: text IMRoPE split-half
pairing/unchanged tail, eight steps of raw convolution history, causal gated
GQA head assignment, and four GDN steps against an independent double-precision
recurrence. The Linux target is also a prerequisite of `make test`.

## Optional ggml dequant comparison

No ggml library is linked into ds4. The following **test-only** comparison uses
an already-built local llama.cpp shared library:

```sh
L=/home/diegom/AI-Projects/llama.cpp
M="$L/build/bin/models/Qwen3.8-27B/Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-IQ3_S.gguf"
tests/run_qwen38_cpu.sh "$L/build/bin/libggml-cpu.so" "$M"
```

For each supported IQ type plus Q2_K/Q4_K: 64 synthetic four-block rows with
finite scales; first and last rows of every matching real tensor; float-input
dots checked against ggml-dequantized weights. This is not a test of ggml's
activation-quantized matmul kernels. Current target covers 402 real tensors.

The external-library sanitizer run has reported 104 bytes leaked during
library/loader initialization after `dlclose`; standalone kernel and engine
session sanitizer runs without that library are clean. Do not report the
external-library run as sanitizer-clean.

## CUDA mixed-IQ MMVQ

The explicit CUDA target checks all nine packed formats used by the language
GGUF at K=5120. Constant activations give a near-exact format/layout oracle;
varied activations include expected Q8_1 activation-quantization error. IQ2_S
also checks the exact get-row path needed by the token embedding.

```sh
make clean
make tests/test_qwen38_cuda CUDA_ARCH=sm_120
make test-qwen38-cuda CUDA_ARCH=sm_120 \
  DS4_TEST_GGML_CPU="$L/build/bin/libggml-cpu.so"
```

The external ggml CPU library supplies only independent host dequantization.
Weights and activations are copied to the RTX GPU; ds4's vendored MIT MMVQ runs
the matvec. This does not validate the not-yet-integrated Qwen CUDA graph.

## Real-model session and continuation checks

Build CPU only (run `make clean` first if switching backends):

```sh
make cpu
cc -O2 -std=c99 -I. tests/test_qwen38_session.c \
  ds4_cpu.o ds4_image.o ds4_distributed.o ds4_tp.o ds4_ssd.o ds4_layer_pack.o \
  -lm -pthread -o /tmp/qwen-session
/tmp/qwen-session "$M" 'The capital of France is Paris.'
```

This checks every final logit after token-by-token eval, no-op sync, changed
prefix/rebuild, and shortening followed by extension. Expected maximum error:
**zero** for the same CPU build. Also tests safe rejection of unsupported cache
save/load. It uses one loaded model and one live session.

Independent llama.cpp C-API probe (same raw text, no BOS/template, sequential
CPU decode, CPU weights, KQV and operation offload disabled):

```sh
cc -O2 -I"$L/include" -I"$L/ggml/include" tests/qwen38_llama_reference.c \
  -L"$L/build/bin" -Wl,-rpath,"$L/build/bin" -lllama -lm -o /tmp/qwen-ref
/tmp/qwen-ref "$M" 'The capital of France is Paris.'
```

Compare `LP position token_id logprob` lines, requiring identical IDs first.
On the checked build/model: mean NLL over 6 tokens is 2.43708414 (ds4) versus
2.42675939 (llama). This is a smoke check, not a statistically robust quality
gate or proof of universal logit parity.

For a longer NLL-only check without repeated session rebuilds:

```sh
T='The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. In a small village, a baker makes fresh bread every morning.'
DS4_NLL_DUMP=1 ./ds4 --cpu --raw -m "$M" -p "$T" --temp 0 -n 1
/tmp/qwen-ref "$M" "$T"
```

Observed 22 scored tokens: NLL 1.73504823 vs 1.72583734, mean absolute logprob
difference 0.02385070, maximum 0.09440743. CPU prefill currently replays tokens
one at a time and is slow. Never run two large model processes concurrently.

Full-session sanitizer build without replacing normal engine objects:

```sh
cc -O1 -g -march=native -std=c99 -D_GNU_SOURCE -DDS4_NO_GPU \
  -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer -c ds4.c -o /tmp/qwen-asan.o
cc -O1 -g -std=c99 -I. -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer \
  tests/test_qwen38_session.c /tmp/qwen-asan.o ds4_image.o ds4_distributed.o \
  ds4_tp.o ds4_ssd.o ds4_layer_pack.o -lm -pthread -o /tmp/qwen-session-asan
/tmp/qwen-session-asan "$M" 'The quick'
```
